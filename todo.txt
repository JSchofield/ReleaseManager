* Modify functional tests so that web server can optionally be started/killed on every test or just once for the whole test suite
* Convert Windsor to fluent configuration API
** Remove references to test projects from the web project
* Modify test driver for ReleaseList.EditComponent so that component actions happen within the EditComponent method - should get around the need for the Parent method
* Make functional tests switchable between different databases
** In some cases, may not want the Functional tests to close the webserver - so the tests can get the website into a particular state and then allow manual exploration
* Functional tests should deploy the test website - using the development web server so I just need to xcopy the files with a particular web.config and any data files
** Some things only work because all projects are built to the same output directory
* Add snapshot reports
* Move jira status map to the database - allow modifications from within the website
** Should I allow each component to reference a different Jira repo and specify different status map?
* Organise stubs, test helpers, database helpers
** Remove dependencies between Functional and Unit tests?
* What version of MVC am I on? upgrade
* FxCop
* Build
* Allow encrypted configuration/persistence of credentials
* In the case of an error the test drivers should capture the error from the page and output it to the console
